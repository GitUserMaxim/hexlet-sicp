<p>In order to take a closer look at delayed evaluation, we will use the following procedure, which simply returns its argument after printing it:</p>
<pre><code>(define (show x)
  (display-line x)
  x)
</code></pre>
<p>What does the interpreter print in response to evaluating each expression in the following sequence?</p>
<pre><code>(define x (stream-map show (stream-enumerate-interval 0 10)))

(stream-ref x 5)

(stream-ref x 7)
</code></pre>
